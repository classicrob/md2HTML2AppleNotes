1. Place a folder of markdown files into this directory and cd into it.
2. Run mdToHTML.py. That will convert all md files in this directory and any subdirectories into HTML.
3. Open up htmlToAppleNotes.scpt in Script Editor. Where it says targetFolder, change the string to the name of a folder you have created in Apple Notes. Then press play, it will prompt you about which folder of HTML files to use.
